Hacked client for Minecraft

This code is public for the sole purpose of letting others reference my code, not for others to download and compile it. Feel free to base your own client core and modules after the ones I created, but don't steal my code.


As of May 23rd 2017, this repo has become public again for issue tracking. Due to problems with code theft, namely people selling my code, I've removed all modules from the repo.
